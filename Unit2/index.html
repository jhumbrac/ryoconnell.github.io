	<h2>Two Websites' Layout and Design You Admire</h2>
	<p>The two websites I chose are <a href="www.petsitusa.com" target="_blank">PetsitUSA</a> and <a href="www.casebriefsummary.com" target="_blank">Case Brief Summary</a>.  I chose these two websites because I work on each, and I am looking to focus my work in this course on improving the sites.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>PetsitUSA: I like the size of the Locate PET CARE in YOUR AREA. The purpose of the site is for visitors to enter their zip code or city/state, so have those letters as the largets and using caps works well.</p>
	<p>Case Brief Summary:  I like the simple use of space on this site.  It is a basic use of 2 columns.  The left is content, and the right has boxes of banner ads and links to other parts of the site.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both use a two column layout for the information sections.  There are links/banner ads on the right, and information on the left.</p>
	<p>One way they are different is that there is more negative space on Case Brief Summary.  There isn't as much content as there is on PetsitUSA.  I think Case Brief Summary could benefit by adding more content, and PetsitUSA could lose some content.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>

		<li>Right is a possible Case Brief Summary layout.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These two layouts are slightly different than the current layouts.  Each still has the focal point as the logo and site name in the top left corner.  The new layout would change the location of the Locate PET CARE zip code box.  It is still the top of the heirarchy, but now it takes up more space and there isn't a picture that takes up valuable space.  The change for the Case Brief Summary is an attempt to change the location of the banner ad in the middle of the page.  The purpose of the site is to make money by advertising, and placing an ad in a new location could draw more attention.  It would change the flow of the page.  This new layout may result in visitors focusing on the ad, at least more than they currently do.</p>
