	<h1>Visual Design Challenge</h1>
	<h2>Two Websites' Layout and Design You Admire</h2>
	<p>The two websites I chose are <a href="www.petsitusa.com">PetsitUSA</a> and <a href="www.casebriefsummary.com">Case Brief Summary</a>.  I chose these two websites because I work on each, and I am looking to focus my work in this course on improving the sites.</p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>PetsitUSA: I like the size of the Locate PET CARE in YOUR AREA.  The purpose of the site is for visitors to enter their zip code or city/state, so have those letters as the largets and using caps works well.<br>
	Case Brief Summary:  I like the simple use of space on this site.  It is a basic use of 2 columns.  The left is content, and the right has boxes of banner ads and links to other parts of the site.
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both use a two column layout for the information sections.  There are links/banner ads on the right, and information on the left.<br>
	One way they are different is that there is more negative space on Case Brief Summary.  There isn't as much content as there is on PetsitUSA.  I think Case Brief Summary could benefit by adding more content, and PetsitUSA could lose some content.</p>
